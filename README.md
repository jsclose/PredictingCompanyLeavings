# PredictingCompanyLeavings

You are a member of the consulting team that is working with a client to boost their HR system. A key pain point for the client is the fact that employees have been leaving the company. They would like to identify which employees are likely to leave so that they can have their HR managers work with those employees in an effort to retain them. To help you in that effort, they have given you all the information they have on their employees including which of them left the company. **You are asked to explore the data and build a predictive model that can accurately predict which employees are likely to quit the company.**
